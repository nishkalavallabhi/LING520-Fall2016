Supermoon is an event that happens when a full moon is closest to Earth. 
It orbits our planet in an oval shape so sometimes it comes closer to us 
than at other times. To us Earth-lings, the moon appears 30 per cent brighter 
and 14 per cent bigger.  By the way, supermoon is not an astrological term. 
It's scientific name is perigee-syzygy, but supermoon is more catchy. 
Astrologer Richard Nolle first came up with the term and he defined it as 
"â€¦ a new or full moon which occurs with the moon at or near (within 90% of) 
its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit", according to earthsky.org.

When is the next supermoon?
Monday, November 14. This supermoon will be the biggest and brightest in 
70 years, so it will definitely be worth a look.  The "undeniably beautiful" 
astronomical event will not come again until November 25, 2034, NASA said.
