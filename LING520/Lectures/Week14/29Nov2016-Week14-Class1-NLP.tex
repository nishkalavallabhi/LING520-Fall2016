\begin{itemize}
\item who is doing what?
\item If you end up finishing your final project during the break, please volunteer to give a short presentation in the class in the last week. Do not consider this as extra work. Be proud of your project and be willing to show it off and get feedback.
\item reminder about grading for the final project: 2.5 marks for initial report, 2.5 marks for final report. 10 marks for implementation. 5 marks for oral exam.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Programming exercise - 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Take any .txt version file from gutenberg.org, written by your favorite author (in English!)
\item Read that file into your python code, and do the following using NLTK:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Split the file into sentences.
\item Print the following: number of sentences in the file, average sentence length (in number of words), average word length (in number of characters), number of unique words, number of unique stems.
\item Note 1: Once sentence splitting is done, you can ignore punctuation markers for the rest of the calculation.
\item Note 2: You can use any stemmer you want.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Programming exercise - 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item For the same file from last slide, do the following:
\item Read that file into your python code, and do the following using NLTK:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Split the file into sentences.
\item For each sentence, print its POS tagged version as a string of tags. E.g., if you have "It is a sentence" as your sentence, and your NLTK tagger outputs the tags for this sentence as a list (or tuple or whatever), you should print the tag as a string. E.g., PRP VBZ DT NN (not as [PRP, VBZ, DT, NN] or as [(It, PRP), (is, VBZ) .. ... ])
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
