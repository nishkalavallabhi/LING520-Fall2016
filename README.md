# LING520-Fall2016
Slides and other materials for my Fall 2016 course at Iowa State University on "Computational Analysis of English" for Applied Linguistics graduate students. 

I got a few requests from acquaintances now starting to teach similar courses. So, I decided to put the materials online.
